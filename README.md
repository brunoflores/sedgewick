# Perspective

Why is algorithm analysis compeling? Few other design activities hold the
potential to reap savings factors of millions or billions, or more.

Also, as the scale of our computational power and out applications increases,
the gap between a fast algorithm and a slow one grows.

1. Decide on a complete and specific problem statement, including indentifying
   fundamental abstract operations that are intrinsic to the problem;
2. Develop a succint implementation for a straightforward algorithm;
3. Improve implementations through step-wise refinement, validating the efficacy
   of ideas through empirical analysis, mathematical analysis, or both;
4. Find high-level abstract representations of data structures or algorithms
   that enable effective high-level design of improved versions;
5. Strive for worst-case performance guarantees when possible, but accept good
   performance on actual data when available.
