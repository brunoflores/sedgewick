# Examples: sequential and binary search

For this example, we might imagine a credit-card company that has N credit risks
or stolen credit cards, and that wants to check whether any of M given
transactions involves any one of the N bad numbers.

We might think of N begin large (10^3 or 10^6), and M beging huge (10^6 or
10^9). Goal of this analysis is to estimate the running times of the algorithms
when the values of the parameters fall within these ranges.
